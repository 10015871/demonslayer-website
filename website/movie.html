Demon Slayer's first season might have wrapped following its 2019 premiere, but the excitement revolving around the series hasn't stopped and Funimation has announced that they'll be teaming with Aniplex to bring the first feature length film of the franchise to North America. During the Industry Panel of FunimationCon 2020, the company announced that they'll be bringing this new adventure of Tanjiro and company aboard a demon infested train to the western hemisphere proper, though a set release date has yet to be confirmed as to when Demon Slayer fans will be able to jump into the movie!

The Mugen Train movie follows the next arc of the anime franchise after the conclusion of the first season of the anime, meaning this will be an essential watch for fans of Demon Slayer if they're looking to continue to learn about the story of Tanjiro and his demon hunting friends. While some franchises have films that take place outside of continuity, like Dragon Ball Z, this upcoming film within the Demon Slayer canon will be the next part of the story that sees the young demon hunter and his sister, Nezuko, hunting down demons to save others from a fate that had befallen them and their family.
